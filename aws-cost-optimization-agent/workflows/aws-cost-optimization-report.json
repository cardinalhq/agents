  "steps": [
    "- Query CloudWatch metrics to collect EC2 CPU and memory utilization data",
    "- Analyze RDS performance metrics including CPU, connections, and IOPS",
    "- Identify resources with utilization below defined thresholds",
    "- Calculate potential cost savings from rightsizing or terminating underutilized resources",
    "- Generate optimization recommendations for each underutilized resource",
    "- Compile findings into actionable AWS cost optimization report",
    "- Send summary notification via Slack for immediate review"
  ],
  "guardrails": [
    "- Define utilization thresholds: EC2 CPU < 20%, RDS CPU < 30%",
    "- Include specific details for each resource: Instance Type, Utilization %, Daily Cost, Recommendation, Potential Savings",
    "- Generate actionable cost optimization recommendations",
    "- Focus on resources with minimum cost threshold above $10/day"
