  "objective": "Monitor PostgreSQL database performance to identify slow queries and optimization opportunities",
  "steps": [
    "- Query PostgreSQL performance metrics including query execution times and resource usage",
    "- Analyze slow query logs to identify queries exceeding performance thresholds",
    "- Examine index usage patterns and identify unused or ineffective indexes",
    "- Assess table scan ratios and identify tables requiring index optimization",
    "- Calculate performance impact and implementation complexity for potential optimizations",
    "- Generate specific optimization recommendations for each identified issue",
    "- Compile findings into comprehensive database performance report",
    "- Send performance alert via Slack for critical issues"
  ],
  "guardrails": [
    "- Define performance thresholds: query time > 1s, execution count > 100/24h",
    "- Include specific details for each issue: Query, Execution Time, Frequency, Index Suggestion, Performance Impact",
    "- Generate actionable database optimization recommendations",
    "- Focus on optimizations with moderate to high impact and low to medium complexity"
