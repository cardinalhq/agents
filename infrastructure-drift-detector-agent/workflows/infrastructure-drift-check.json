  "steps": [
    "- Query GitHub repository for infrastructure configuration changes",
    "- Compare current infrastructure state with repository configurations",
    "- Identify configuration drift between expected and actual states",
    "- Analyze the impact and risk level of detected drift",
    "- Generate recommendations for resolving configuration drift",
    "- Compile comprehensive infrastructure drift report",
    "- Send drift alerts via Slack for critical configuration changes"

  "guardrails": [
    "- Define acceptable drift thresholds and risk levels",
    "- Include specific details for each drift: Resource, Expected Config, Actual Config, Risk Level, Resolution",
    "- Generate actionable infrastructure remediation recommendations",
    "- Focus on high-risk drift that impacts system stability or security"
